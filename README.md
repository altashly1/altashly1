# 👋 Hi, I’m Abdulrahman Alswaidan

🎓 I’m a Master’s student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University, working under Prof. Varner. My research focuses on applying mathematical modeling and computational techniques to simulate financial markets and complex systems.

---

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- Stochastic modeling (e.g., Hidden Markov Models)
- Reinforcement Learning (e.g., Q-learning for optimal pathfinding)
- Time-series analysis and financial simulations
- Scientific computing and numerical methods in Julia
- Optimization, control theory, and applied machine learning

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Advanced topics in asymptotic analysis, PDEs, and stability theory  
- Finite element methods and spectral analysis  
- Techniques for scalable simulations and data visualization in Julia  
- Best practices for modular, maintainable scientific codebases

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Julia packages for financial data analysis  
- Computational frameworks for decision-making under uncertainty  
- Open-source projects that connect chemical engineering principles with machine learning

## 📫 How to reach me:
- 📧 aa2725@cornell.edu  
- 💼 [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/abdulrahman-alswaidan-374541100)  

## 😄 Pronouns:
He/Him

## ⚡ Fun fact:
When I’m not debugging reinforcement learning agents, I’m probably fine-tuning a simulation of stock market dynamics using ideas from chemical process engineering.
